# isolated-workers Documentation

Welcome to the isolated-workers documentation. This library provides type-safe worker process management for Node.js applications.

## What is isolated-workers?

isolated-workers extracts proven patterns from Nx's isolated plugin architecture to provide:

- **Type-safe IPC** - Full TypeScript inference for messages between host and worker
- **Worker lifecycle management** - Spawn, connect, and gracefully shutdown workers
- **Request/response patterns** - Automatic correlation with timeout support
- **Cross-platform support** - Unix domain sockets and Windows named pipes
